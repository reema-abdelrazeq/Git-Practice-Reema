# Git-Practice-Reema

# Part 1: Theoretical Questions

1. **What is the difference between Git and GitHub?**  
Git is a version control system used locally to track code changes.  
GitHub is a cloud platform used to host Git repositories and collaborate with others.

2. **Explain the difference between `git pull` and `git fetch`.**  
`git fetch` downloads changes from the remote repository but does not merge them into your local branch.  
`git pull` performs `git fetch` followed by `git merge`, so it both downloads and automatically merges the changes into your local branch.

3. **What is the purpose of a `.gitignore` file?**  
It tells Git which files or folders to ignore and not track — such as cache files, logs, or system-specific files — to keep the repository clean.

4. **Describe the steps to contribute to an open-source project on GitHub:**  
- Fork the repository  
- Clone it locally  
- Create a new branch  
- Make changes and commit them  
- Push the branch to your fork  
- Create a Pull Request to the original repository
